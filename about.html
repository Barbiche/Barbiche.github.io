<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I am a French software developer, based in Lyon.</p>
<p>As an engineer, my main interests are game development and computer graphics, and a VR enthusiast. Basically I am interested in anything as long as it is creative and shiny.</p>
<p>I do really enjoy music, 3D modeling, history, pastry, getting lost alone in strange places, and beers.</p>
